# Project-2 Easy Site

EasySite is a one stop, turnkey, solution for individuals or businesses that would like to template a single 
or multiple landing page(s),basic blog websites or stand-alone brand pages.

We wanted to  create a simple solution to a common need in todayâ€™s highly technological world.

A simple app that will create an even simpler website for its user.

Our motivation to create this app came from a similar problem that friends of ours were facing --> they needed a simple website to showcase themselves online and did not want to pay lots of money to have it done.

## The Easy-Site Market 

* Performance Marketers
* Blog websites
* Contract template generation for small to midsize businesses
* Single Standing e-commerce web pages
* Artists (portfolios)

## How It Works

Using Express, Node.JS, SQL, Handlebars, jQuery, HTML5 and Bootstrap to plan out and build (part of) a robust 
web application that stocks web page templates for potential customers and offers custom deliverables by request.

As a user, I want to be able to create an account, save my credentials, and then view all available templates.
There are pre made templates to choose from, or I can inquire about a custom made web page. We offer stand alone and 
multi page websites.

## Individual Responsibilities 

Nate: Create web page templates, utilize handlebars  
Keith: Develop backend server, establish connections to front end and backend
Corey: Presentation, organization of outside work, some project management
Stefan: Handlebars templating, site design and website concept. 
Wilson: Initiate the GIT Repo, supply customized boilerplate

## Challenges

* Communication between group members
* All group members had their own weaknesses with the understanding of the code required
* Collaborating on github
* Motivational factors affecting our abilities to push through the difficulties while learning the code simultaneously
* This was a very complex project, and as a group, we should have had a talk about how to proceed early on. 

## Improvements

Our app is simple as it is, we would have liked to make it more customizable for our users.
Improvements we would like to make for the future include:

* Splitting the finished website into several sections including nav bar, header, body, and footer
* Allowing for the addition of extra html pages. For example a contact me page, as well as individual accomplishments
